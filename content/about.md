I'm an Artificial Intelligence Engineer at [appliedAI](https://www.appliedai.de/), Europe’s largest initiative for the application of leading edge trustworthy AI technology with the vision to shape Europe’s innovative power in AI.

I am currently working on Natural Language Processing use cases with different clients and at the same time trying to contribute to open source projects.

I'm an Artificial Intelligence Researcher at [Avira](https://www.avira.com/).
I research the use of traditional Machine Learning methods as well as Deep Learning 
methods for the detection of Malware script files and develop systems to train and evaluate said methods end-to-end in the Cloud.

I'm passionate about Machine Learning, Software Development, Natural Language Processing and Distributed Systems. 

I hold a M.Sc. in Embedded Systems from the [Technical University 
of Kaiserslautern](https://www.uni-kl.de/en/home/) and a M.Sc. in Automation and Control Systems from the [Ecole Nationale Polytechnique](http://www.enp.edu.dz/) in Algiers.
