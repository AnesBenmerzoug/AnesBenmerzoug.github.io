I'm a Senior AI Engineer at [appliedAI Initiative](https://www.appliedai.de/), Europe's largest initiative for the application of leading edge trustworthy AI technology with the vision to shape Europe's innovative power in AI.

I'm passionate about machine learning, robotics, software engineering, and open-source development.

I am currently working on LLM and Agent projects for different clients.

When I'm not staffed on client projects, I work on internal projects,
contribute to open-source projects such as [pyDVL](https://github.com/aai-institute/pyDVL)
and help with [TransferLab](https://transferlab.ai/authors/anes-benmerzoug)'s research projects
such as the [replication](https://github.com/ReScience/MLRC/blob/main/2022/32/article.pdf) of
the [If You Like Shapley Then You'll Love the Core](http://procaccia.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/core.pdf) paper.

I hold a M.Sc. in Embedded Systems from the [Technical University
of Kaiserslautern](https://www.uni-kl.de/en/home/) and a M.Sc. in Control and Automation from
the [Ecole Nationale Polytechnique](http://www.enp.edu.dz/) in Algiers.
