    "In this post we will see how to use a local LLM to extract structured information from emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I joined appliedAI Initiative in 2021, my first project involved using AI to extract information from emails for a company that develops a document management system. At that time, LLMs were not as advanced as they are today, so we decided to train a custom model from scratch. However, we faced challenges, particularly because we did not have labeled data, and due to privacy restrictions, we couldn't use the company's customer data. As a result, we resorted to manually labeling emails from the [Enron dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/)[^enron].\n",
    "\n",
    "[^enron]: Enron Corporation was an American energy, commodities, and services that went bankrupt in 2001 after ascandal involving a corporate fraud case. The Enron Email Dataset, containing 500,000 internal emails, provides valuable insights into the company’s operations and is widely used for research in text mining and network analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, our approach yielded suboptimal results for several reasons, such as the mismatch between the Enron dataset and the actual customer emails and the lack of labeled training data. Today, however, extracting information from emails has become simpler than ever, and in this post, I want to demonstrate the improvements we can achieve with using LLMs."

For this, we use [llama-cpp-python](https://llama-cpp-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python wrapper for [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), to run a local LLM. This approach allows us to pass a JSON schema, ensuring structured output without needing to adjust the prompt repeatedly in order to coerce the LLM into generating valid JSON data.\n",

    "In this post, we have seen how a local LLM can be used to extract structured information from emails, provided you have access to the email content and the necessary permissions. We also explored how adding an example to the system prompt (few-shot prompting) can significantly improve the extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post is intended as a demonstration of how structured information extraction can be done with modern LLMs. For real-world applications, however, you would likely face additional constraints, such as more complex datasets, stricter privacy considerations, and the need for larger datasets to improve accuracy and robustness."
