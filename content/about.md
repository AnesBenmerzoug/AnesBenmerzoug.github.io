I'm an Artificial Intelligence Researcher at [Avira](https://www.avira.com/) 
where I research and develop systems used to detect malware Office files
in the cloud.

I hold a M.Sc. in Embedded Systems from the [Technical University 
of Kaiserslautern](https://www.uni-kl.de/en/home/) and an M.Sc. in Automation and Control Systems
from the [Ecole Nationale Polytechnique](http://www.enp.edu.dz/) in Algiers.
