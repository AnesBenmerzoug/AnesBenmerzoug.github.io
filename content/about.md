I'm an Artificial Intelligence Researcher at [Avira](https://www.avira.com/) 
where I research and develop systems that detect malware Office files.

I hold a M.Sc. in Embedded Systems from the [Technical University 
of Kaiserslautern](https://www.uni-kl.de/en/home/). 
Before that I attended the [Ecole Nationale Polytechnique](http://www.enp.edu.dz/) in Algiers
where I received a M.Sc. in Automation and Control Systems..
