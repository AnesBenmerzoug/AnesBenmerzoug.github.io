         Matt

         I am passing on these penalties for non-performance Friday for the
        firm volumes that did not flow.  The firm sales amount of which you did not
        perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend
        traded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages in
        the amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  I
        would like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose is
        not the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firm
        as are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose and
        Alberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this a
        serious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in the
        California market place and are treating it as such.  Our companies have had
        a longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we can
        regain trading together in the future.  A letter outlining the above will be
        sent to yourself  and John Lavorado for your records.

         Thanks

        Hey Mark, great to hear from you.  I actually went to Argentina and Chile
        about 5 years ago for 2 weeks and had a blast.  I'd love to go back for a
        longer period.  I was recommending it to Linda for a new place to go.

        It sounds like things are going well for you in Houston.  I wish I knew you
        were down there.  I was down for a weekend in July.  My college roommate and
        his wife and their kids live there.  He's a 6th? 7th? year in Skadden's
        Houston office.  Charles Still.  Ever work with him?  I'll let you know when
        I'm back down there.

        Have you been back to the Caribbean lately?  I was back in April for a week
        in the BVI.  I really missed the place.  Do you ever get to Chicago?  Let me
        know if you're going to be around.  Take care.

        much - just working too hard.  Hope you're well!

        Thank you for using our automated self service password reset option.

        The user id and password in SAP (Apollo Production and HR Production), eHRonline, iBuyit and iPayit are all synchronized.  When you reset your password in eHRonline, it automatically synchronizes the password in the other systems.

        2.       Click on the   button
        3.       Enter your User Id (SAP Personnel Number) and temporary password (located at the bottom of this email)
        4.       You will then be asked to change your password
        5.       Enter your new password twice
        6.       Once you have successfully changed your password in eHRonline, you have synchronized your password for SAP (Apollo Production and HR Production), eHRonline, iBuyit and iPayit
        7.       If you were trying to access an application other than eHRonline, close eHRonline and proceed to the desired application.  You will now be able to log in with your NEW password.

        Torrey,

        Here are the new mappings for the EOL products, except for the central desk.  Hunter is still working on his but I wanted to get you something.

        for physical rest of month deals we attached the physical book id
        for prompt month physical deals we attached the TAGG book id

        is that correct?


        I will send the finished product when Hunter is done.  Keep in mind it will probably change again.

        Hello Mr. Hughson,

        Ronald Melicher adviced me to contact you about the PhD program.
        I am interested in the field of finance and I wanted to learn about the
        PhD finance program at the University of Colorado.
        Can you summarize the main points of the program, its requirements,and
        the deadlines?

        Two years of coursework, economics, econometrics, and finance seminars are what most people normally take.  Math skills are important initially.  Later on, it depends what you do.  Then you take comps and write a thesis.  I think that the deadlines and such are on our website.  The program starts in the fall, and you are advised to start then.  As far as admissions requirements, take the GMAT or GRE, and do well.  We have many applicants with >700 on the GMAT, for instance.



        I have finished a finance degree from Oregon State University and have
        two years of work experience.

        Work experience is not much help, unless it specifically relates to what you are working on.  Abstraction is an important skill, and at best, work experience can help you with getting rid of extraneous detail.

        Sincerely,
        Monika Causholli

        Sabra,

        I have extended the current FP&L sitara #217969 to the end of the deal
        (2/2010).

        Keeping the same deal # helps us keep up with the value.

        I set it up with the volumes we booked in TAGG, I know the volumes and
        locations will change but if you could send me and Yuan an e-mail when you
        have made your change during bid week we will make the changes to the hedge
        deal.


        Thanks,

        Kam


        ps.  Scott, you will not see any problems with this deal in the future.
        Sorry for the trouble.

        Greg,

        You and I met at your office last summer to discuss Aprimo's Marketing
        Management Solution. At the time, you indicated that there would be other
        people at Enron that I should speak with. My assigned territory changed
        shortly after our meeting, and I did not follow-up on these contacts. I am
        once again responsible for Enron, and would appreciate your direction to the
        appropriate individuals at Enron.

        Our web-based solution has been adopted by over 60 leading companies over the
        past 18 months. They are seeing rapid value from Aprimo's unique ability to
        help them Grow Top-Line Revenue (more effective Marketing) and Reduce
        Bottom-line Cost (more efficient Marketing). With the opportunities facing
        Enron, I'm certain that maximizing your Marketing Investments is of interest
        to the Executive Team and your Shareholders.

        Our solution is delivering improvements across all Marketing Functions, such
        as:

        - Event Management
        - Marcom
        - Marketing Financial Management
        - Strategic Planning
        - Direct Marketing
        - Web Response
        - Lead Management

        Leading Analysts have identified Aprimo as the clear leader in Enterprise
        Marketing Management. I would like to arrange brief discovery meetings with
        some of the individuals responsible for Marketing's contribution to Enron's
        growth.

        I would appreciate any direction that you and Liz can provide.

        Regards,
        Vince LaGrange

         As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale
        Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services
        Legal Department.

         The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the
        legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed
        the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve
        greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

         To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will
        include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor,
        Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron
        Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

         The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More
        comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

        Ray and ISAS -

        Just going through the past four days of email, so please excuse this
        response if it has been already addressed.

        What was said at the Jan 17th meeting of the ESWG was, I (Bob Harshbarger)
        was not prepared to address the issues surrounding voting, membership, etc.
        at that meeting.

        ESWG will have to adopt some form of structure if we are to proceed as
        quickly as the ESC.  The ESWG was formed at the direction of the Joint
        Guidance Committee.  We have been asked to consider formalized or structure
        membership based on the same guidelines that ISAS has been given.  The
        intent is not to leave anyone out but to ensure we can address issues in a
        timely manner.

        There is no perfect solution.  A weighted sector voting structure does
        appear to give broader voice to the masses, yet even within a single sector
        the participants can opposing view points and still feel under represented.
        What the ESWG adopts is to be seen.
