         Matt

         I am passing on these penalties for non-performance Friday for the
        firm volumes that did not flow.  The firm sales amount of which you did not
        perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend
        traded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages in
        the amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  I
        would like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose is
        not the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firm
        as are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose and
        Alberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this a
        serious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in the
        California market place and are treating it as such.  Our companies have had
        a longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we can
        regain trading together in the future.  A letter outlining the above will be
        sent to yourself  and John Lavorado for your records.

         Thanks

        his wife and their kids live there.  He's a 6th? 7th? year in Skadden's
        Houston office.  Charles Still.  Ever work with him?  I'll let you know when
        I'm back down there.

        Have you been back to the Caribbean lately?  I was back in April for a week
        in the BVI.  I really missed the place.  Do you ever get to Chicago?  Let me
        know if you're going to be around.  Take care.

        Beavers make plans to invade Arizona
             Associated Press

             TEMPE, Ariz. -- Oregon State capped its remarkable emergence from more
        than a
             quarter-century of football ineptitude by accepting an invitation to
        play Notre Dame in the Jan. 1
             Fiesta Bowl.

             The Beavers were the top choice of the Fiesta Bowl selection committee
        because they were "a
             conference co-champion, a 10-win team and an incredible turnaround
        story that somewhat mirrors
             what Kansas State has done," Fiesta Bowl president John Junker said.

             "For us to come here from where we were three years go, to go 10-1, and
        being in the Fiesta
             Bowl against Notre Dame is a great story," Oregon State coach Dennis
        Erickson said Sunday.

             As Oregon State's opponent, Virginia Tech had a higher ranking and
        better record, but the Fiesta
             could not resist the Irish (9-2) and their huge nationwide following,
        even though Notre Dame was
             ranked only 11th in the final Bowl Championship Series standings.
        Oregon State is sixth.

             It will be a matchup of teams that weren't even in the top 25 in the
        preseason.

             "I don't think any of us in our wildest imagination would have thought
        this would have been the
             matchup," Junker said.

             Notre Dame won its last seven games to become bowl eligible at 9-2.

             The Fiesta considered Miami but decided the Notre Dame-Oregon State
        matchup was more
             intriguing, and that the Hurricanes were a better fit against Florida
        in the Sugar Bowl.

             Fiesta Bowl officials maintained that comments last week by Pac-10
        commissioner Tom Hansen
             had no impact on their decision. He suggested the conference should
        pull out of the BCS if
             Oregon State was left out of the Fiesta Bowl.

             "We selected Oregon State because they deserved it and won it on the
        field of battle," Junker
             said.

             The Fiesta Bowl normally gives an automatic berth to the Big 12
        champion, but it had two at-large
             picks this year because Oklahoma will play Florida State for the
        national championship in the
             Orange Bowl.

             Oregon State set an NCAA record for futility with 28 consecutive losing
        seasons, a streak broken
             when the Beavers went 6-5 last year in Erickson's first season and lost
        to Hawaii in the Oahu
             Bowl.

             This year, Oregon State tied Washington and Oregon for the Pac-10
        title, their first since 1964.
             That team, coached by Tommy Prothro, lost to Michigan in the Rose Bowl.
        A 35-year bowl
             drought followed.

             Notre Dame, by contrast, is a regular at major bowls. Its last
        appearance in one of the big-four
             bowls was in 1996, the Orange Bowl. But this Irish team was not
        expected to get this far,
             especially after a 2-2 start. There was widespread speculation then
        that coach Bob Davie would
             be out of a job when the season ended.

             Davie did not want to talk about vindication.

             "I think so much attention is always placed on the head coach, and I'm
        sure Dennis would agree
             with me. This isn't about us. This is about our football players and
        our assistant coaches who put
             so much into this.

             "That was a little bit overrated before the season and it's a little
        bit overrated now. This certainly
             isn't about me."

             Each team will receive $12 million to $13 million. Oregon State will
        split the money with the rest
             of the Pac-10, but Notre Dame, as an independent, keeps it all. No
        wonder Davie was so anxious
             as he watched the Oklahoma-Kansas State game, knowing that a K-State
        victory could have sent
             Notre Dame to a much lesser holiday payday.

             "It was brutal," he said. "As good as Oklahoma is, and as well coached
        as they are, I almost
             went crazy when it was fourth-and-1 and they were in that shotgun for
        that draw, but they know
             what they're doing. It was painful watching that game."

             Junker said Oregon State officials have promised 30,000 or more fans
        will come to the desert from
             the Northwest for the game. Add to that Notre Dame's unparalleled
        national following, and the
             Fiesta already has been declared a sellout. Each school will receive
        15,000 tickets.

             Beaver players like the idea of playing Notre Dame.

             "I didn't like them growing up," running back Ken Simonton said. "I
        don't like 'America's teams.' I
             don't like everybody's favorite. I was always an underdog."

        Torrey,

        Here are the new mappings for the EOL products, except for the central desk.  Hunter is still working on his but I wanted to get you something.

        for physical rest of month deals we attached the physical book id
        for prompt month physical deals we attached the TAGG book id

        is that correct?


        I will send the finished product when Hunter is done.  Keep in mind it will probably change again.
        Kam

        Hello Mr. Hughson,

        Ronald Melicher adviced me to contact you about the PhD program.
        I am interested in the field of finance and I wanted to learn about the
        PhD finance program at the University of Colorado.
        Can you summarize the main points of the program, its requirements,and
        the deadlines?

        Two years of coursework, economics, econometrics, and finance seminars are what most people normally take.  Math skills are important initially.  Later on, it depends what you do.  Then you take comps and write a thesis.  I think that the deadlines and such are on our website.  The program starts in the fall, and you are advised to start then.  As far as admissions requirements, take the GMAT or GRE, and do well.  We have many applicants with >700 on the GMAT, for instance.



        I have finished a finance degree from Oregon State University and have
        two years of work experience.

        Work experience is not much help, unless it specifically relates to what you are working on.  Abstraction is an important skill, and at best, work experience can help you with getting rid of extraneous detail.

        Sincerely,
        Monika Causholli

        Sabra,

        I have extended the current FP&L sitara #217969 to the end of the deal
        (2/2010).

        Keeping the same deal # helps us keep up with the value.

        I set it up with the volumes we booked in TAGG, I know the volumes and
        locations will change but if you could send me and Yuan an e-mail when you
        have made your change during bid week we will make the changes to the hedge
        deal.


        Thanks,

        Kam


        ps.  Scott, you will not see any problems with this deal in the future.
        Sorry for the trouble.

        Greg,

        You and I met at your office last summer to discuss Aprimo's Marketing
        Management Solution. At the time, you indicated that there would be other
        people at Enron that I should speak with. My assigned territory changed
        shortly after our meeting, and I did not follow-up on these contacts. I am
        once again responsible for Enron, and would appreciate your direction to the
        appropriate individuals at Enron.

        Our web-based solution has been adopted by over 60 leading companies over the
        past 18 months. They are seeing rapid value from Aprimo's unique ability to
        help them Grow Top-Line Revenue (more effective Marketing) and Reduce
        Bottom-line Cost (more efficient Marketing). With the opportunities facing
        Enron, I'm certain that maximizing your Marketing Investments is of interest
        to the Executive Team and your Shareholders.

        Our solution is delivering improvements across all Marketing Functions, such
        as:

        - Event Management
        - Marcom
        - Marketing Financial Management
        - Strategic Planning
        - Direct Marketing
        - Web Response
        - Lead Management

        Leading Analysts have identified Aprimo as the clear leader in Enterprise
        Marketing Management. I would like to arrange brief discovery meetings with
        some of the individuals responsible for Marketing's contribution to Enron's
        growth.

        I would appreciate any direction that you and Liz can provide.

        Regards,
        Vince LaGrange

        Christopher -

        Based upon your memo and our due diligence effort to date, is there any
        indication of (a) any steps Daishowa has taken to put the committee required
        under the Pay Equity Act or (b) any increase in compensation that would be
        consistent with the Pay Equity Act and therefore enable Daishowa to dispense
        with the need for a committee?  Is there any way to currently assess what
        potential liabilities could be or to view any industry data on this issue
        that may indicate how extensive liability could be???

        The main concern is that we are negotiating with Daishowa to be in a position
        to undertake, as of closing, all responsibilities associated with all matters
        disclosed, unless there is a legal noncompliance issue (e.g., failure to
        maintain proper permits).  Since the requirements of the Pay Equity Act have
        not been identified to management as a concern, I need to ensure that this is
        a real issue (mostly from a $'s exposure standpoint) vs. something so remote
        that it should not even be discussed.

        Please let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

         As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale
        Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services
        Legal Department.

         The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the
        legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed
        the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve
        greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

         To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will
        include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor,
        Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron
        Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

         The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More
        comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

        Ray and ISAS -

        Just going through the past four days of email, so please excuse this
        response if it has been already addressed.

        What was said at the Jan 17th meeting of the ESWG was, I (Bob Harshbarger)
        was not prepared to address the issues surrounding voting, membership, etc.
        at that meeting.

        ESWG will have to adopt some form of structure if we are to proceed as
        quickly as the ESC.  The ESWG was formed at the direction of the Joint
        Guidance Committee.  We have been asked to consider formalized or structure
        membership based on the same guidelines that ISAS has been given.  The
        intent is not to leave anyone out but to ensure we can address issues in a
        timely manner.

        There is no perfect solution.  A weighted sector voting structure does
        appear to give broader voice to the masses, yet even within a single sector
        the participants can opposing view points and still feel under represented.
        What the ESWG adopts is to be seen.

        It's more than just my understanding.   All employees hired in 2001 will receive 20% of base in stock options granted on last business day of year.  Strike price is price of stock at close of market on last bus. day of year.
        see ya,
